### Take discount or Not


The program first calculates the total cost of buying all items without the coupon by summing up all their prices. Then, it calculates the total cost with the coupon: this includes the coupon price X plus the sum of all item prices after applying the discount Y (but no item price can go below zero).

If the total cost with the coupon is strictly less than the total cost without it, the program prints "COUPON" meaning it’s worth buying the coupon. Otherwise, it prints "NO COUPON" because the coupon doesn’t save money
